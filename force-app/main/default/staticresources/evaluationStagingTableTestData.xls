definitely prepared to lead in any future colloquiums. At the beginning of the first session he
explained the rules that everyone understood very quickly, even the ones who
were less experienced in Liberty Fund’s colloquiums. Cabieses began each
session with a brief summary of the readings and asked several questions to get
the discussion started. Many times during the sessions he introduced concepts
from the readings and helped organize the different issues the conferees were

He clearly leans more conservative than many of our other participants - he works with David Beito at Alabama and, as a historian, I think he has clearly staked out where he wants to be relative to the overall discipline (much further to the right), but he was very aware of and respectful of the differences of opinion between the more libertarian of the group and himself.

He is clearly very intelligent, though, as a sociologist, he was working uphill against a lot of philosophers, political scientists and (relatively few, for us) economists. But he did quite well in that context, and he's definitely worth investing further in and keeping in our network because I think he's likely to succeed in academia or some related field.

Unfortunately, Mark has decided to become a pharmacist to ""make money"" before he goes ""full time into ideas."" I'm pretty confident Mark can do whatever he wants to do and will be successful in any field he chooses, so it's just a shame that he's decided to move away from a leveraged career. I wouldn't necessarily invite him to another student AT but I would consider passing his name onto development and connecting him with our online programs.

I think the latter is unlikely - from what I could tell during conversations at meals and socials, Dmitry is very intelligent and very much engaged in how to apply the principles of markets and classical liberalism to practical issues. He has been involved in political activism in his native Russia for years, and he has firsthand experience of what it requires to persuade his friends and family to fight oppression by the state.

I was somewhat surprised that, given his interest in Smith, he wasn't a little more familiar with Smith's entire corpus, but he hasn't started writing yet, either.

Coleman talked about her using his site to connect to more people and get her name out there. Sara just finished her MFA about a year ago, but she had gone back to school after years of working on set with film productions, so she is older than most of the newly graduated alumni (she’s in her 30s).

From London he is continuing to work on his thesis film for his MFA from Columbia. He originally planned to start shooting in Feb/March, but his lead actor is tied up with a new HBO series (Vincent Piazza, Boardwalk Empire. It’s being produced by Martin Scorcese, so there’s already a lot of buzz about the series, and will be a breakout role for this actor). This is great news for Andrew’s project, because while it pushes back their production, it has been great for fundraising—raises the profile of the production significantly.","Within Expectations","1003318_1012086","","1012086"
"1003318","Florin was a marvelous contributor to discussion- made very serious points about the filmmakers style, craft, intentions, significance in film history, etc. that the rest of the group found very valuable for discussion. Multiple participants commented to me that they were very glad he was there—he traveled further than any one else in the group so I think they were especially happy to have the chance to meet him. A very gifted young Romanian filmmaker, Florin’s first feature film (in Romanian) will be premiering at the Berlin International Film Festival next year (a prestigious festival in Europe). He’s currently working on another film, for which he is scouting locations in Peru. So while he lives mostly in Romania these days, he traveled to the conference from Lima. He did his MFA at Columbia University, which is how IHS came to know him- he was a two-time winner of our Film & Fiction scholarship. Florin comes off as very serious at first, but he is very polite, well-spoken, and interested in discussion. He has a dry sense of humor, which comes out more when you get to know him better. He’s an impressive person and worth keeping in touch with.","Within Expectations","1003318_17726","","17726"

"1003242","Bev was in the middle tier of participants. She made regular contributions to the discussion, but her contributions were not marked by the insight of the top participants. She seemed to have a difficult time stepping away from common biases and assumptions, and this seemed to get in the way of her understanding of the readings. Her responses to the readings were more reactionary than reasoned or critical in tone, and she was more likely to share a personal emotional response than a response that offered an evaluation of the writings. She did an adequate job as a participant, but I would not be inclined to invite her back.","Below Expectations","1003242_1011048","","1011048"
"1003242","Susan was a solid contributor to the discussion. She participated about as much as an average participant, but her contributions were generally either thoughtful comments about important passages from the text or valuable insights about practical implications of a particular reading. She was a bit more inclined to defend Wilson's constitutionalism than to engage it critically. I wouldn't place her at the top of the list of participants to invite again, but I wouldn't rule her out.","Below Expectations","1003242_1011050","","1011050"
"1003242","Jeff was one of the top tier of participants in this colloquium. He was active, but not too active, and his comments were always thoughtful and well informed. Though he began the program with a distaste for Wilson, he did his best to read Wilson carefully and to engage with his ideas honestly. I am certain he left the program with a much more nuanced and substantive critique of Wilson's constitutionalism, and with a better appreciation for the Constitution that Wilson did so much to undermine. I don't think Jeff would be out of place at a standard Liberty Fund colloquium.","Within Expectations","1003242_1010269","","1010269"

Much of what she said was of value, but the value of her interesting contributions was often outweighed by the distraction of some of her less interesting contributions. She seemed to have no internal editing mechanism, and contributed just about everything that occurred to her to say during the weekend. This may have had the effect of crowding out the participation of others. Because of her inability to edit her comments, I would be unlikely to invite her to participate again.","Below Expectations","1003242_1011051","","1011051"

This is unfortunate because the few comments she did make during sessions indicated that she had insights worth sharing, as did comments she made during informal discussions. She did mention in private conversation that she felt out of place talking about Wilson and the Progressive era, and I suspect she was intimidated by the format. Because I don't think her participation at this program accurately reflected her ability to contribute, I wouldn't totally rule her out of a future invitation, but I'd want to see her participate in a different Bill of Rights Institute program before considering including her in another Liberty Fund.","Below Expectations","1003242_1011223","","1011223"

Her contributions were not marked by the depth of insight of the top tier of participants, but she did focus on the texts, and her comments generally served to connect an academic discussion with the concerns of a high school social studies teacher.

"1003242","Megan was a relatively late addition to the invitation list to replace a participant who changed plans about a month prior to the program. We invited her because she lives in the DC area and because the quality of her participation in an earlier BRI/LF program indicated that she merited another invitation. She was the first person to jump on the queue in our first session, but her participation was less frequent than most throughout the rest of the program. I attribute her reticence to speak to several factors: First, because she was a replacement, she only got the materials a month before the conference, so she didn't have as much time to absorb the readings as most of her colleagues. Second, she is a relatively young teacher and she may have felt a bit intimidated by some of the more active participants.

I would suggest that Dr. Wilson keep a written queue in the future as he struggled to remember who was on the list. I would also liked to have seen more clear direction being pushed in the discussion. Everyone seemed to be all over the place, and I would have liked to have seen Brad set the participants on a course that they could handle.

"1003742","Ray, as he is called, was a good participant. Active, thoughtful, well read. I would gladly include him again.","Within Expectations","1003742_1017174","","1017174"
"1003742","Greg was a very active participant. He was critical of Jefferson, but not in any strident way, and not without providing reasoned bases for his criticisms. Given his support of the Federalist critique of Jefferson, he was a good person to have around the table, as he provided a strong point of view for others to work against. I would gladly include him again.","Within Expectations","1003742_1018295","","1018295"
"1003742","Courtney was a fine participant. Most of her comments focused on the theme of vindicating Jefferson, which was perhaps understandable in a conference where there were several participants critical of Jefferson. I would include her again.","Within Expectations","1003742_1013391","","1013391"
"1003742","Ed was a solid participant. Contributed regularly, focused on the text. I would include him again.","Within Expectations","1003742_1018296","","1018296"

"1003742","Dakota was a good participant. He was familiar with Liberty Fund through IHS, and was comfortable contributing right away. He was inclined to speak a bit less than average, but his comments were of greater depth than most. I would certainly include him again.","Within Expectations","1003742_1018301","","1018301"
"1003742","Jennifer was an active participant. Some of her contributions were in the form of questions, but on the whole her comments served to advance conversation. I would include her again.","Within Expectations","1003742_1014948","","1014948"
"1003742","Shayne was a solid participant. He read and prepared carefully, and made comments that served to open new avenues for discussion. I would include him again.","Within Expectations","1003742_1018303","","1018303"
"1004001","Jeffery was a fantastic participant who's bright and insightful mind brought much to our conversations. Though he did not speak up too many times in each discussion, when he did, his comments were relevant, helpful, and steered the conversation in new and thoughtful directions. Jeffery's analytical mind helped simplify complex themes and summarize various threads to help other participants understanding. I would very gladly have Jeffery back for another conference.","Within Expectations","1004001_1020459","","1020459"
"1004001","Zach was a good participant who's contributions helped drive our conversation throughout the week. Zach arrived over 15 minutes late to two morning sessions. However, Zach is a young teacher who I think benefited greatly from the discussions. He was always eager to participate and actively listened when he was not speaking. I would recommend Zach to future conferences though with a little reservation.","Within Expectations","1004001_1020460","","1020460"
"1004001","Stacy was a great participant who helped keep our conversations moving with her frequent and helpful contributions. Her eagerness to learn and enjoyment of the discussions was evident from the first session to the last. Her comments helped draw out the best in others and helped take our discussions in new and interesting directions. She was civil in disagreements and always happy to clarify if there was a misunderstanding in her remarks. Stacy was a fantastic participant and I would gladly have her back in future programs.","Within Expectations","1004001_12821","","12821"
"1004002","Ken is so great and thoughtful and terrific with the students. He is a wonderful teacher and really skilled at this format.","Within Expectations","1004002_69867","","69867"
"1004002","Ted brought a lot of big intellectual content and context to the table, and was not afraid to push and challenge the students. He is a master reader of texts like these and really made the content consistently interesting. He is encouraging with the students and a lot of fun in and out of session.","Within Expectations","1004002_74486","","74486"
"1004002","Nicholas is a very well-spoken person. He was among the most active and thoughtful participants at this conference. He also held it out for the classical liberals as a counter to some of the more conservative participants. But he is a careful reader and routinely made insightful comments. He was great socially out of session, too.","Within Expectations","1004002_1018781","","1018781"
"1004002","Nick is earnest and active in and out of session. He has an easy personality and a good mind for integrating disciplinary approaches to his reading of the assigned texts. He made a lot of good observations.","Within Expectations","1004002_1020693","","1020693"
"1004002","Laura is enthusiastic about ideas and was well-prepared for the conference. A history major, she had some good insights on the historical context of the readings, as well as their significance then and now. She is a great person to have in the group and was lively in and out of session.","Within Expectations","1004002_1020694","","1020694"
"1004002","Emily is a wonderful person and a good young scholar. She is a careful reader and a consistent participant. She is great in and out of session. She wants to pursue a career in public policy. She will bring a principled approach to that career.","Within Expectations","1004002_1020695","","1020695"
"1004002","Shiza is a very pleasant person. She has a good mind and her contributions were thoughtful. Also wonderful to have as part of the group. She will pursue a law career with a view to being a future judge. She has the intellectual foundation to do so effectively.","Within Expectations","1004002_1019688","","1019688"
"1004002","Sofia is a wonderful person and participant. Soft-spoken but very bright. She made many good and thoughtful interjections. She is almost totally blind and a guide dog accompanies Sofia, which is incredibly well-behaved and charming.","Within Expectations","1004002_1019589","","1019589"
"1004002","Francis is an earnest young man, a student at the Naval Academy who is leading a growing ISI club there. He reads carefully and is very excited by the world of ideas.

"1004002","Margaret is an absolute delight. She has a powerful mind and presence, with a yet gentle spirit and good sense of humor. One of the strongest participants.","Within Expectations","1004002_1020697","","1020697"
"1004002","Madeline is very nice and smart. She has a keen mind and a great sense of humor. It was good to have her in the group. She was a steady contributor, so somehow I think it would have been good to hear from her some more. I think it was her first Liberty Fund conference, but not her first ISI conference as she is a Honors Fellow. In that case, she did very well for an initial seminar.","Within Expectations","1004002_1020698","","1020698"
"1004002","El Rogers was amazing, She is one of the most articulate participants I have had at any conference, let alone this one. She is fun and very bright and always prepared and active in session.","Within Expectations","1004002_1020699","","1020699"
"1004002","McBride is a real character. He is an active ISI leader on his campus, He also has a massive following on Instagram for his side modeling work.

"1004230","Christoph was a consistent participant of all phases of the program, and while he was not the most talkative, what he had to say was worth hearing and considering.","Within Expectations","1004230_1015854","","1015854"

"1004230","Eric spoke only once or twice in the formal sessions all weekend, and seemed more interested in taking notes and following along rather than participating. This was his second program with us, and I had thought that he would grow after his first LF a few years ago, but unfortunately he either did not understand the format and expectations, or chose to be passive.","Below Expectations","1004230_1020139","","1020139"
"1004230","James spoke once only during each session, and contributed little to social times, mostly just sitting quietly during meals.","Below Expectations","1004230_1023011","","1023011"
"1004230","Jeff participated in all sessions, but often his remarks were limited to his teaching experience and perspectives that did not seem reliant or based on the documents. I believe that he could grow in his understanding of this type of intellectual experience if he attended more of such programs.","Within Expectations","1004230_1014918","","1014918"
"1004230","Jeff was an enthusiastic and regular speaker during all sessions and an eager conversationalist during meals. His contributions were limited to comments, and always in the form of long commentary on the motivations of the individuals involved in the events under consideration, albeit without any factual support or evidence from the documents. He also seemed to have little control over the words he chose, sometimes leading to incoherent statements wherein he contradicted himself within a few sentences by stating the opposite of what one would assume was next in his line of reasoning. He rarely spoke briefly, and often jumped to conclusions about what others were saying, and then turned out to be wrong. Glib.","Below Expectations","1004230_1023007","","1023007"
"1004230","Jennifer expressed concern about being able to participate to a high level after the first session, and it really seemed that she was intimidated by the format. By Session 2 she stepped out of her comfort zone and picked up steam throughout the rest of the weekend, offering interesting comments and questions with increasing frequency. She was a good conversationalist during social times and a solid contributor to every session.","Within Expectations","1004230_1023002","","1023002"
